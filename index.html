        <h2 class="display-4">What is Git?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            Git is a version control system used by developers. It allows you to track and 
            record changes you make to your files.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are working on a project, especially if you're working with a team, it is important 
            to save different versions of your files as your project progresses. Git is a program you run 
            on your local machine that allows you to document changes and save versions. This way you can 
            revert to a previous version if something breaks or you decide you do not like a recent change. 
            After you make changes you can <a href="#stage">stage</a> a file and then <a href="#commit">commit</a> 
            which will add metadata to your file and save changes to your local machine. Then it is important 
            to also move the updated file to a place where other developers can access it, such as GitHub. 
            You can use Git to <a href="#push">push</a> your file up to a <a href="#repositories">repository</a> 
            on GitHub. Git also allows you to <a href="#">pull</a> files from GitHub back to your local 
            machine.
        </p>

    <section id="what-is-github" class="container py-3">
        <h2 class="display-4">What is GitHub?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            GitHub is an open-sourced platform used by developers to host projects, store different 
            versions and collaborate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While Git allows you to track changes on your local machine, GitHub is a place you can store various 
            versions of your project where other developers can access them. GitHub is open source, meaning it 
            is free to use and open to the public. Why might you want to put your work on a platform where other 
            developers can see it and use it? It's good to give back to the community! Share code, contribute 
            ideas and give and receive feedback.

        <p>
            Check out <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>! 
            Make an account and start looking at other developers code and think about sharing your own. 
            Keep in mind, employers will look at your GitHub account. They want to see what you've done and 
            what you're working on!

        <h2 class="display-4">Repositories</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            A repository is a fancy name for a folder. However, it's not just a regular folder. A repository will 
            not only store files for your project but will also track the changes made to those files. 
        </p>  
        <p> 
            You'll often hear developers call them a "repo" for short. On your local machine a repo will have 
            a .git folder where it will store the tracked changes. You can create a new repo on GitHub by 
            selecting the <span class="badge badge-success text-white p-2">New</span> button. You will need to name 
            your repo and then write a short description. It is important to make your repo public so other 
            developers, team memebers or future employers can see your work. Also make sure to check the 
            "initialize this repository with a README" box. This will allow you to clone the repo to your local 
            machine.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            To clone your repo onto your local machine first go to and open your repo on GitHub. Click on 
            <span class="badge badge-success text-white p-2">Clone or download</span> and copy the web URL. 
            Next open Git and use the command <kbd>git clone</kbd> followed by the copied link for your new repo. 
            Now your repo will show up on your own computer as a new folder.

        <p class="lead">
            After you have made a few changes to your file you will need to stage the changes, save the new version 
            as a commit, and then push the new version up to your GitHub repository. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Git keeps track of changes you've made to a file. When you run git status it will list the file as 
            untracked meaning a new version has not been tracked or saved yet. In order to save the new version 
            you will first need to stage the file. After you have staged the file use git status again and you 
            will see the file is now listed under "changes to be committed". Next you will need to commit the 
            file and a new version of the file will be saved on your local machine. Next you will need to push 
            the commit up to the master branch on your GitHub repo. This way everyone else can see the changes 
            you have made. When you push up the file Git will make a unique id that records the push so you can 
            track the history of the file.

                            Once a file is staged it is ready to be commited. To commit the file use the commit 
                            command followed by a string in quotes that is a brief message describing the 
                            purpose of this commit. Afterwards you can check git status again to see the file 
                            is no longer staged.

                            After a commit has been made you will need to push this new version of your file 
                            to the master branch on GitHub. To push the file use the push command. You will 
                            receive some output from Git and the new version of your file and a new commit 
                            will appear in your GitHub repo.
